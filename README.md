# üìä Machine Learning 
  
- [ ] [Sci-Kit Learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)  **Scikit Learn** is a general machine learning library built on top of NumPy. It features a lot of utilities for general pre and post-processing of data. It is a library in Python used to construct traditional models.  


# ü§ñ Deep Learning
**Tensorflow** is the most famous library in production for deep learning models. Offers automatic differentiation to perform backpropagation smoothly, allowing you to literally build any machine learning model literally.  **Keras** is a high-level API built on Tensorflow. It is user-friendly and helps quickly build and test a neural network with minimal lines of code. Like building simple or complex neural networks within a few minutes. Modular since everything in Keras can be represented as modules.
